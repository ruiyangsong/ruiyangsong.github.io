For 1PPHA, it is difficult to distinguish the number of domains and their boundaries from the distance map. Therefore, the boundary division of this example is very ambiguous. Although both Cath and SCOP give the same answer of domain number, their boundaries are not similar. CATH results in multiple discontinuous residue fragments, while SCOP will retain continuous fragments. The answers of UniDoc and PDP are consistent with SCOP, while the result of SWOAD is neither inconsistent with Cath nor SCOP.

For 1PJQA, it can be observeds from the distance map that the boundary is not clear from the residue fragment 1-215 and residue fragment 216-457, and the number of domains in the answers given by Cath and SCOP is also inconsistent. In residue fragments 113-213, CATH divides it into two domains, while SCOP retains one. The results of UniDoc and PDP are consistent with SCOP, while SWIRD and SCOP are consistent; In residue fragments 216-457, SCOP still retains this part as a complete unit, and CATH divides it into two parts. However, it can be seen from the figure that the contact of residue fragments 214-331 and 332-457 is very sparse. The results of different methods are also consistent with CATH.
